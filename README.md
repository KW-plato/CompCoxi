This is a project for the AC Computational Cognition Course.
We analyze raw dataset shared online by another research group. 
The following steps are performed:
1. Data cleaning and transformation
2. Exploratory analysis using visualizations
3. Statistical analysis (replicate results + additional questions we ourselves ask about the data)
